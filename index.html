                <h2>Hello,</h2>
                <br>
                <p>I am Jonas pons, an avid explorer, entrepreneur and passionate  adventurer who has visited over 75 countries and looking forward to many more.... </p>
                <br>
                <p>I am driven by my curiosity,  that being  my fuel to accomplish the goals I set for myself. As a sports scientist , I acquired a remarkable experience, which has enhanced my understanding of human motivation and transformation. Helping my clients to break their limitations is my life purpose. Sports is a very important part of my life, and it is reflected in every adventure that I take part in. </p>

                <h2>Everything began when someone said "you can't do it",</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="first">
                    <p>when they tried to limit him based on their own fears and stigma. Everything began with a man with ambition, ambition to explore, to know, to go beyond anything anyone could see at first glance, to travel through the unexplored, to undertake, to create and innovate  in order to elevate  human awareness.  Everything began with a man who wasn't afraid to give it all, nor to experience the unknown, everything began with a challenge.<br><br>That man, who faced extreme hardship at a very young age, decided to refuse defeat and destructive mechanisms. Instead, he chose to, embark on an adventure, beyond any perceived limitations, that would leave anyone open-mouthed. That man took his backpack and devoted himself to exploring the world without much in his pocket, visiting more than 75 countries and had the luxury of learning, enjoying and knowing what was beyond tourism -  reality and true beauty: the authentic.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <p>In 2 years, with a backpack on his shoulder, he committed himself to challenge the ordinary, such as swimming with whale sharks, being massaged by snakes, diving with  sharks, feeding crocodiles, hitchhiking Australia, experiencing silent retreats for weeks in India, biking across Spain, competitive running, traveling throughout western africa on a motorcycle, climbing the Kazbegi mountain range,  trekking in Nepal, diving in unknown territories in Maldives and Philippines, skydiving in Dubai. In times of human conflict, he  dared to visit Iraq, Mali and Burkina Faso, without prejudice, without fear, only with ambition of adventure in order to understand the true authentic human condition.<br><br> Even as intrepid as he was, he managed to embark on his career completing a Masters degree program in Sport Sciences within a record time of 4 years instead of 5, worked as a personal trainer in Valencia and Ibiza. Developing his entrepreneurial qualities, he also launched a Croquetería business in The Philippines. 
                        In his never ending quest to challenge himself, this man has even more bold adventures to fulfill: Swimming the  Gibraltar strait, crossing the world on a sailboat and to fly the skies of the world by a small plane. At the end, that man showed himself that HE COULD, and that man soon will help others to break their limitations through a journey of self-exploration.
